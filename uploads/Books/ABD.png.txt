The backup protection is provided as the main protection can fail due to many
reasons like,

1. Failure in circuit breaker

2. Failure in protective relay

3. Failure in tripping circuit

4, Failure in dc. tripping voltage

5. Loss of voltage or current supply to the relay

Thus if the backup protection is absent and the main protection fails then there is
a possibility of severe damage to the system.

When the primary protection is made inoperative for the maintenance purpose, the
backup protection acts like a main protection. The arrangement of backup protective
scheme should be such that the failure in main protection should not cause the failure
in back up protection as well. This is satisfied if back up relaying and primary
relaying do not have anything common. Hence generally backup protection is located
at different stations from the primary protection. From the cost and economy point of
view, the backup protection is employed only for the protection against short circuit
and not for any other abnormal conditions.
